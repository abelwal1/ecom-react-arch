# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Libraries & Packages Used in the application :

**Reactstrap** : Used for CSS & UI Design purpose
**Redux**: For State Management




Best practices for scalable ReactJS enterprise app development
How the development process should go depends heavily on your project’s specifics. But there are a few practices that can help prepare your application for future growth.

Implement testing from the start
During the initial stages of a development project, writing automation tests might seem like a pointless chore since there are only a few components. However, if you want to build a scalable app, it’s vital to implement testing as soon as possible. Doing so will make it easy to continue testing as your codebase grows. 

Leverage tools that can help you scale
While you shouldn’t add too many tools to your project, it’s a good idea to adopt valuable tools that can help you build a scalable app. These tools include Prettier, ESLInt, and libraries such as React Router, React Hook Form and date-fns. 

Organize your project files properly
Organizing your project files properly and naming them logically will make it easier to manage them as your application grows. For example, it’s good practice to create folders for each component and place all related files, including the unit test file, in that folder. 

Build a library for UI and logic components
Building a component library will allow the development team to share and reuse components. In addition, you can utilize a platform like a Bit to manage the collection. And also include logic in the library with hooks. 

Use hooks to decouple components from the logic
Hooks are a feature of React that development teams can use to decouple logic from components. Developers can write custom hooks to share logic across components.  

ReactJS best practices



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
